<a id="background" class="anchor" href="#background" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background.</h3>

<p>There are many animals ending up in shelters every year. 35% (2.7 millions out of 7.6 millions) of dogs and cats are euthanized by the shelter due to no adoptions for long or disease, and the rest of them are able to be adopted, transfered or returned to owners by animal adopter. We believe that some animals required more help than others to find a adopter. Currently, the animal shelters are using experience or knowledges to make a subjective judgement to decide it, such as their looking, age and size. However, we can use more information including breed, color, sex, name to make a better judgement. For example, we want to research the relationship between a pet's outcome and whether it has name. If we are seeing pets with names have more probability to find permanent home, we should suggest animal shelters spent more time on naming pets. Whether a pet has a name or not is just one factor of this project, and we will use Machine Learning and Regression to help animal shelter find key factors that impact the outcomes of animals in a quantified way.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes">Kaggle</a> is hosting a competition since March 21, 2016 to help improve outcomes for shelter animals, in which more than 302 teams participate to predict the outcome of each animal using a dataset of intake information including breed, color, sex, and age from the <a href="http://www.austintexas.gov/department/animal-services">Austin Animal Center</a> from October 1st, 2013 to March, 2016. The insights could help shelters focus their energy on specific animals who need extra help finding a good adopter.</p>

<p>At the mean time, Kaggle will provide <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes/data">test data</a>, and all submissions are evaluated using the multi-class logarithmic loss (see evaluation detail at <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes/details/evaluation">here</a>). </p>

<a id="project-objectives" class="anchor" href="#project-objectives" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Objectives</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Find how each factor given (breed, whether has a name, color, sex, animal type, age and breed) impact animal outcomes and visualize them using ggplot2. Give suggestion to animal shelters based on every factor's impact on the outcome how to increase the better outcomes of animals. </p></li>
<li><p>Complete feature selection and build up statistical/ machine learning models to predict the outcome. Use cross validation, test validation to check the performance of prediction. Then we are able to predict the outcome or whether an animal need extra care every time we have a name animal enter into animal shelter. </p></li>
<li><p>Participate in the Kaggle competition and evaluate prediction results using multi-class logarithmic loss. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Visit <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes/data">Animal Outcome data</a> to check train data and test data provided by Austin Animal Center via Kaggle.com. See brief data description as below:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>AnimalID</strong>: unique ID provided by Austin Animal Center for each animal</li>
<li>
<strong>Name</strong>: Animal names (blank if animal is nameless)</li>
<li>
<strong>DateTime</strong>: Date and Time Upon Outcome</li>
<li>_<strong>OutcomeType</strong> _: Animal Outcomes (Return_to_owner,Euthanasia, Adoption, Transfer, Transfer, Transfer)</li>
<li>
<strong>OutcomeSubtype</strong>: more detailed of outcome</li>
<li>
<strong>AnimalType</strong>: Cat or dog</li>
<li>
<strong>SexUponOucome</strong>: "Neutered Male", "Spayed Female", "Neutered Male", "Intact Male", "Neutered Male" and "Intact Female"</li>
<li>
<strong>AgeUponOutcome</strong>: Age of animals in day, week, month and year.</li>
<li><strong>Breed</strong></li>
<li><strong>Color</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4>
<a id="data-wrangling" class="anchor" href="#data-wrangling" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data Wrangling:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>*create a new column hasname to show whether animal has name or not. 1 means has name, and 0 means does not have a name. </li>
<li>*create a new column namelength to count length of characters of each animal's name</li>
<li><p>*create a new column namepop to show the popularity of a new with an assumption that specific name might be welcomed more than others. </p></li>
<li><p>DateTime
** Create three new columns <strong>Hour</strong>, <strong>Weekday</strong> and <strong>Month</strong> with assumption that time will impacts if people want to adopt animals. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>SexUponOucome
*</em> Create a column <strong>Sex</strong> showing only male and female
** Create a column <strong>Intact</strong> showing if an animal being spayed/neutered or not.</p>

<p><em>AgeUponOutcome
*</em> Create <strong>AgeinWeeks</strong> to unify age in week. </p>

<p><em>Breed</em></p>
