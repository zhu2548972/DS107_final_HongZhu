We believe that some animals required more help than others to find a adopter. Currently, the animal shelters are using experience or knowledge to make a subjective judgement to decide it, such as their looking, age and size. However, we can use more information including breed, color, sex, name to make a better judgement. For example, we want to research the relationship between a pet's outcome and whether it has name. If we are seeing pets with names have more probability to find permanent home, we should suggest animal shelters spent more time on naming pets. Whether a pet has a name or not is just one factor of this project, and we will use Machine Learning and Regression to help animal shelter find key factors that impact the outcomes of animals in a quantified way.\r\n\r\n[Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes) is hosting a competition since March 21, 2016 to help improve outcomes for shelter animals, in which more than 302 teams participate to predict the outcome of each animal using a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes/data) of intake information including breed, color, sex, and age from the [Austin Animal Center](http://www.austintexas.gov/department/animal-services) from October 1st, 2013 to March, 2016. The insights could help shelters focus their energy on specific animals who need extra help finding a good adopter.\r\n\r\nAt the mean time, Kaggle will provide [test data] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes/data), and all submissions are evaluated using the multi-class logarithmic loss (see evaluation detail at [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes/details/evaluation)). \r\n\r\n\r\n### Project Objectives\r\n* Find how each factor given (breed, whether has a name, color, sex, animal type, age and breed) impact animal outcomes and visualize them using ggplot2. Give suggestion to animal shelters based on every factor's impact on the outcome how to increase the better outcomes of animals. \r\n\r\n* Complete feature selection and build up statistical/ machine learning models to predict the outcome. Use cross validation, test validation to check the performance of prediction. Then we are able to predict the outcome or whether an animal need extra care every time we have a name animal enter into animal shelter. \r\n\r\n* Participate in the Kaggle competition and evaluate prediction results using multi-class logarithmic loss. \r\n\r\n### Methodology\r\n\r\n#### Data Description\r\nVisit [Animal Outcome data] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes/data) to check train data and test data provided by Austin Animal Center via Kaggle.com. See brief data description as below:\r\n\r\n* **AnimalID**: unique ID provided by Austin Animal Center for each animal\r\n* **Name**: Animal names (blank if animal is nameless)\r\n* **DateTime**: Date and Time Upon Outcome\r\n* _**OutcomeType**_: Animal Outcomes (Return_to_owner,Euthanasia, Adoption, Transfer, Transfer, Transfer)\r\n* **OutcomeSubtype**: more detailed of outcome\r\n* **AnimalType**: Cat or dog\r\n* **SexUponOucome**: \"Neutered Male\", \"Spayed Female\", \"Neutered Male\", \"Intact Male\", \"Neutered Male\" and \"Intact Female\"\r\n* **AgeUponOutcome**: Age of animals in day, week, month and year.\r\n* **Breed**\r\n* **Color**\r\n\r\n#### Data Wrangling\r\n\r\n* _**Name**_\r\n - create a new column **hasname** to show whether animal has name or not. 1 means has name, and 0 means does not have a name. \r\n - create a new column **namelength** to count length of characters of each animal's name\r\n - create a new column **namepop** to show the popularity of a name with an assumption that specific name might be welcomed more than others. \r\n\r\n* _**DateTime**_\r\n - Create three new columns **Hour**, **Weekday** and **Month** with assumption that time will impacts if people want to adopt animals. \r\n\r\n* _**SexUponOucome**_\r\n - Create a column **Sex** showing only male and female\r\n - Create a column **Intact** showing if an animal being spayed/neutered or not.\r\n\r\n* _**AgeUponOutcome**_\r\n - Create **AgeinWeeks** to unify age in week. \r\n\r\n* _**Breed**_\r\n - create a new column **breedpop** to show the popularity of each breed \r\n\r\n* _**Color**_\r\n - create **is_black** to show if an animal is purely black\r\n - create **is_white** to show if an animal is purely white\r\n - create **multi** to show if an animal has multiple colors. \r\n\r\n#### Data Visualization\r\nTo learn the impact of each factor to the outcome of animals' outcome, I plot the impact of each factor and some of their interaction variables to the outcome. \r\n\r\n#####Name and Age Upon Outcome\r\n\r\nBy looking at the raw data, I notice the column Name for each observation in my dataset, however, not every single animal has a name, some of them do not. To learn the relationship of animal age, if it has name and its outcome, I draw a plot as shown below.\r\n\r\n![Name and Age](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhu2548972/Shelter-Animal-Outcomes/gh-pages/images/Screen%20Shot%202016-04-23%20at%2010.30.26%20PM.png)\r\n\r\nWe can tell from the plot that younger animals (animals younger than 8 weeks) have lower probability to have names, it should be because employees in animal center were too busy to give a newly-born animal a name. However, an animal younger than 8 weeks will have a much better chance to be adopted and lower chance to be transferred if it has a name. It is not surprising to see from the top graph that animals have much higher probability to have a name as they grow up, however, we are seeing the same pattern that animals with names are much more easily to be adopted on animals in all life stages. In addition, senior animals (animals older than 60 weeks) without names have much higher probability to be euthanized in animal shelter. I assume that it should be easier for potential adopters to have connections with animals with names, since animals may be trained to response if people call their names. \r\n\r\nGiven such different outcomes between animals with names and without names, I would recommend animal shelters spend time in naming animals and train them by calling their names, especially for senior animals and baby animals (animals in the first and fourth life stages).\r\n\r\n#####Time and Date Upon Outcome \r\nI learn how the day time (hour), weekday, month impact animals outcomes by graphing histograms. \r\n![Time](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhu2548972/Shelter-Animal-Outcomes/gh-pages/images/time_and_outcome.png)\r\n\r\n#####Animal Type\r\nWe have more dogs than cats in this given dataset. Dogs and cats have equal chance to be adopted, but dogs have higher chance to be returned to owner and lower chance to be transferred to others than cats. \r\n![Type](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhu2548972/Shelter-Animal-Outcomes/gh-pages/images/TypeOutcome.png)\r\n\r\n#####Sex and Intactness Upon Outcome\r\nBoth male and female animals have similar chance to have all kinds of outcomes, but intact animals have much lower chance to be adopted and higher chance to be transferred or returned to owners than spayed/neutered animals. \r\n![Sex1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhu2548972/Shelter-Animal-Outcomes/gh-pages/images/Sex1.png)\r\n![Sex2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhu2548972/Shelter-Animal-Outcomes/gh-pages/images/Sex2.png)\r\n\r\n#####80-20 Rule in Color and Breed of Animals\r\nIn training data, all animals share 366 colors and 1380 breeds in total. However, these colors and breeds are not equally spreaded among all animals, I figured an 80-20 rule existing in the distribution of breeds and colors: the majority animals have very small amount of breeds and colors. \r\n![Colors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhu2548972/Shelter-Animal-Outcomes/gh-pages/images/Colors.png)\r\n![Breeds](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhu2548972/Shelter-Animal-Outcomes/gh-pages/images/Breeds.png)\r\n\r\n###Predictive Modeling\r\n3 models are used in the modeling work. The train data is divided to train set and validation set. 80% of the original train data (21383 observations) is used to train and 20% of the original train data (2219 observations) is used to validate. \r\n####Random Forest\r\nThe first model is random forest. 2800 trees are built. The variable importance shows that the most important variables are AgeWeeks, intact, Hour, NameWeirdness, BreedWeirdness, NameLen, Month and Weekday. This model achieved logloss of 0.767 on the validation data.\r\n\r\n####Gradient Boosting Machine (gbm package)\r\nThe second model is gradient boosting machine by the gbm package. I tuned the parameter by cross validation and the final model achieved a log loss of 0.764 on the validation data.\r\n\r\n####Gradient Boosting Machine (xgboost package)\r\nThe third model is also gradient boosting machine but it's built by the xgboost package. As usual, I tuned the parameter by cross validation and the final model achieved a log loss of 0.755 in cross validation.\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\nIn the end, I used a weighted average to ensemble the 3 models, and it achieved a log loss of 0.7375 as shown in the picture, which ranked 39th out of 305 teams on the leaderboard at this time. \r\n![Score](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhu2548972/Shelter-Animal-Outcomes/gh-pages/images/Score.png)\r\n\r\nLater I also ensemble the result of a public script and achieved a log loss of 0.73039, and pushed up my rank to 34th, as shown in the picture.\r\n![rank](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhu2548972/Shelter-Animal-Outcomes/gh-pages/images/rank2.png)\r\n",
